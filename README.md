## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

This app is designed for 12th Grade CBSE Students to master one mark questions before the 12th Board Exams.

Hi! I'm Manoj Elango and I'm a 12th grader too stuck at home during the quarantine. I took this chance to help students to study one mark questions with more ease and completely online. There's no signup or membership features, everything is free to everyone. You can support me by sharing this with all your friends.

Here are some of the features of the app:
*Built using flutter and dart to create a simple and easy to use guide for one mark questions.
*Specifically for maths, chemistry and physics
*Board Questions and Some Basic Definitions for each chapter in each chapter
*Specific Name Reactions for Chemistry
*Completely free with no ads
*Minimal Space Consuming
*No Internet Required
